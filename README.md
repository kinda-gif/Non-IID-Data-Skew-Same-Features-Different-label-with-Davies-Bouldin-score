# Non-IID-Data-Skew-Same-Features-Different-label-with-Davies-Bouldin-score
SFDL_DB is a Python library for generating Same Features, Different Label (SFDL) skew sub-datasets. It utilizes KMeans clustering and the Davies-Bouldin Score to determine the optimal number of clusters (k), facilitating the creation of non-IID data distributions crucial for Federated Learning research.
